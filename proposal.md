# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Title: DOORS

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Me and my partners will be creating a text based adventure game sorta like Colossal cave game if you've heard of it. It will not be as in depth as that because that game has like 700+ lines of code and yeah thats too much. We also plan too add graphics and texture probably through Ren'Py.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

  Our software will promt questions to make the user provide the answer. The user will pick one of three doors they are faced with and there will be a question behind that door that they then have to answer to continue. This is going to be the main function of the game. It will be executed through vs code more then likely and also Ren'Py for the graphics. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Neither of us are not combing our final project with anything from any of our classes.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

  Name: Jayna Marie coltellino, Email: jayna.coltellino@temple.edu, TA: Elmaira Talebiankraki     Name: Makiyah Skye Jones, Email: makiyah.jones@temple.edu,  TA: Yihan

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO      A good outcome for our project would be for us to have a complete text based adventure game with our own storyline and graphics. Our graphics will hopefully consist of adventure time like graphics from the TV show on cartoon network. We will accomplish a complete text based adventure game with some sort of graphoics i feel it's going to be very challenging for us to clone/create the graphics from adventure time just because of all the texture and unique shapes they use in the show. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

   A better outcome would be to have a complete text based adventure game with exact graphics from adventure time maybe even array of characters that couldve been in the show but weren't. Like we make a complete game with our own characters and cloned graphics. I think we will be able to accomplish most of this before the deadline hopefully all of it.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO         The best outcome is to have a 1:1 game with our own twist on adventure time charachters, graphics, and textures. I hope to have a complete text based adventure game with at least the graphics done if the characters fall behind that will have to be fine but i think we can do it.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what? 

TODO      Me and my partners plan to begin our project at the beginning of next week, We will need to reserch more about Ren'Py as well as how we go about coding graphics into the game. We are also going to plan who's going to do what tomorrow Friday the 8th. I hope to do the graphics and drawings of the chaarcters also assist with writing the main code for the game. I will need to continue practicing my python skills through codeacedemy and maybe go through a few tutorials on text based games and graphics if it's avalible. I feel pretty comfotable as of now to give this project a shot, the graphics is the only thing that's giving me a scare only because i've never really coded true graphics or cloned i should say.
